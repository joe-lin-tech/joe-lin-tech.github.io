> In May 2022, I ran a virtual autonomous vehicle expo/conference for my Boy Scouts Eagle service project with the hopes of spreading awareness about the engineering, ethics, and policymaking of autonomous vehicle technology. This website was built atop Gatsby + Tailwind and served as the central platform for event information and logistics.
