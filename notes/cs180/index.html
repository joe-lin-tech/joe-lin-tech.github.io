</code></pre> <p>To prove the correctness of this algorithm, we must show that it (1) terminates, (2) produces a perfect matching, and (3) results in a stable matching.</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Claim: Gale-Shapley terminates in at most \(n^2\) iterations.</strong> <ul> <li>By brief inspection, we can prove termination by noticing that the while loop will run at most \(n^2\) iterations and thus, in total, hospitals make at most \(n^2\) proposals.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Claim: Gale-Shapley produces a perfect matching.</strong> <ul> <li> <strong>Subclaim: Gale-Shapley produces a matching.</strong> Since hospitals only match with the best unmatched student, they are in at most one pair. Since students only keep the best offer, they are also in at most one pair. Because both hospitals and students appear in at most one pair, the algorithm produces a matching.</li> <li> <strong>Subclaim: All hospitals and students are matched.</strong> We can show that all hospitals are matched with a proof by contradiction. Suppose that there exists a hospital \(h\) that is unmatched at the end of the algorithm. Since there are \(n\) hospitals and \(n\) students, an unmatched hospital implies an unmatched student \(s\). This means that \(s\) was never given an offer. However, \(h\) must have offered to all \(n\) students. Thus, by contradiction, all hospitals are matched. It follows that if all hospitals are matched and every hospital is matched to at most one student, then all students are matched.</li> <li>Since Gale-Shapley produces a matching and all hospitals and students are matched, we can conclude that it produces a perfect matching.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Claim: Gale-Shapley produces a stable matching.</strong> <ul> <li>We can prove this by contradiction. Suppose the matching \(M\) from Gale-Shapley is not stable, meaning that there exists an unstable pair \(h-s\). We know that \(h\) prefers \(s\) over \(s'\) and \(s\) prefers \(h\) over \(h'\), where \(s'\) and \(h'\) are their current matches in \(M\). There are two cases for which this could occur. <ul> <li> <strong>Case 1:</strong> \(h\) never offers to \(s\) and \(h\) ends up offering to \(s'\) in \(M\). However, since \(h\) offers in order of preference, this would imply that \(h\) prefers \(s'\) over \(s\) and hence we have a contradiction.</li> <li> <strong>Case 2:</strong> \(h\) offers to \(s\), but \(s\) rejects \(h\) for \(h'\). However, this means that \(s\) prefers \(h'\) over \(h\) and hence we have a contradiction.</li> </ul> </li> <li>By contradiction, we have proven that the Gale-Shapley matching \(M\) does not have an unstable pair and thus produces a stable matching.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <dl> <dt>valid partner</dt> <dd>a student \(s\) is a <strong>valid partner</strong> of \(h\) if there exists any stable matching with \(h-s\)</dd> </dl> <p><strong>Claim: Gale-Shapley is hospital-optimal.</strong></p> <h2 id="proof-techniques">Proof Techniques</h2> <h3 id="loop-invariants">Loop Invariants</h3> <dl> <dt>loop invariant</dt> <dd>a <strong>loop invariant</strong> is a condition that must be true before entering the loop, after each iteration, and after the loop has completed</dd> </dl> <h3 id="induction">Induction</h3> <p><strong>Claim: Any \(2n \times 2n\) board with any square removed can be tiled with L-shaped tiles for any \(n\) greater than or equal to \(1\).</strong></p> <p>We can prove this with induction.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Base Case:</strong> For \(n = 1\), we have a \(2 \times 2\) board.

When ordering functions, we can first identify which broad category they belong to and then order each class of functions. For instance, we want to rank the following functions: \(\log{n^n}, n^2, 2^{\log{n}}, \log^2n, n^n, n^{\log{n}}, 2^n, 2^{1000}, n^{\sqrt{2}}\).</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Constant</th> <th style="text-align: left">Logarithmic</th> <th style="text-align: left">Polynomial</th> <th style="text-align: left">Exponential</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">\(2^{1000}\)</td> <td style="text-align: left">\(\log^2n\)</td> <td style="text-align: left">\(\log{n^n} = n\log{n}, n^2, 2^{\log{n}} = n, n^{\sqrt{2}}\)</td> <td style="text-align: left">\(n^n, n^{\log{n}}, 2^n\)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For the polynomial functions, we immediately know that \(n \lt n^{\sqrt{2}} \lt n^2\). For \(n\log{n}\), we can factor out \(n\) from all \(4\) functions and since we know that constant \(\lt\) logarithmic \(\lt\) polynomial functions, then the final ordering is \(n \lt n\log{n} \lt n^{\sqrt{2}} \lt n^2\).</p> <p>For the exponential functions, we can compare them by taking the \(\log\) of every function. We can do this because \(\log\) is an order-preserving function. So, we get \(n\log{n}, \log^2n, n\).

It’s important to note that because \(l\) is halved at every iteration, the size of the input array for <code>max</code> is also halved. It follows that the runtime for the max operation is actually \(c_4 \cdot \frac{n}{2^i}\), where \(i\) corresponds to the number of times \(l\) has been halved. We know that the number of times \(n\) can be halved is \(\log{n}\). So, in summary, we have the following:</p> \[\begin{aligned} T(n) &amp;= c_1 + \sum_{i = 0}^{\log{n}} (c_2 + c_3 + c_4 \frac{n}{2^i}) \\ &amp;= c_1 + \sum_{i = 0}^{\log{n}} (c_5 + c_4 \frac{n}{2^i}) \\ &amp;= c_6 + c_5 \log{n} + \sum_{i = 0}^{\log{n}} c_4 \frac{n}{2^i} \\ &amp;&lt; c_6 + c_5 \log{n} + c_4 n \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} \\ &amp;= c_6 + c_5 \log{n} + 2 c_4 n \end{aligned}\] <p>Now, we can apply asymptotic notation, giving us \(T(n) = O(n)\).</p> <h2 id="graphs">Graphs</h2> <dl> <dt>graph</dt> <dd>a <strong>graph</strong> \(G = (V, E)\) is a collection of <strong>vertices</strong> \(V\) of size \(n\) and <strong>edges</strong> \(E\) of size \(m\)</dd> <dt>degree</dt> <dd>in an <strong>undirected graph</strong>, the <strong>degree</strong> of a vertex is the number of edges for which it is an endpoint</dd> </dl> <p><strong>Claim: The sum of degrees of all vertices in a graph is twice the number of edges.</strong> We can prove this with a loop invariant, where after \(i\) iterations, the sum of degrees for all vertices is \(2i\).</p> <h3 id="graph-representation">Graph Representation</h3> <dl> <dt>adjacency matrix</dt> <dd>an <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> is a \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) where \(A_{u, v} = 1\) if \((u, v)\) is an edge</dd> </dl> <p>An adjacency matrix has two representations for each edge of an undirected graph (\(A_{u, v} = A_{v, u}\)).

Let us pick a leaf node \(v\), which is a vertex with degree \(1\). If we remove \(v\) and the edge \(e\) that connects it to the rest of the tree, we obtain a graph \(T'\) with \(n\) vertices. We know that \(T'\) is also a tree because removing an edge and vertex doesn’t create a cycle and \(T'\) is trivially connected. Since \(T'\) is a tree on \(n\) vertices, then by the inductive hypothesis, \(T'\) has exactly \(n - 1\) edges. Now, we readd the \(v\) and \(e\) from before to obtain \(T\).

We know that \(V\) can be partitioned into \(L\) and \(R\), which we can color blue and green, respectively.

By our previous result, \(G\) is also two-colorable. Now, suppose we have a \(k\)-length cycle in \(G\), \((v_0, v_1, ..., v_k)\). Let’s color the vertices at even indices blue and at odd indices green. Since this is a cycle, \(v_0 = v_k\) and they must have the same color. \(v_0\) is colored blue, so \(v_k\) must also be blue, which implies that \(k\) is even. Thus, for any arbitrary cycle in \(G\), it must be of even length.</li> <li>(←) We want to prove that if a graph does not contain an odd length cycle, then it is bipartite. Let’s pick an arbitrary \(v \in V\) and use breadth first search to partition the vertices into \(L\) and \(R\) according to the evenness of their distance from \(v\). A vertex is in \(L\) if the distance is even, otherwise it is in \(R\). Now color vertices in \(L\) blue and vertices in \(R\) green. We want to show that no monochromatic edge exists and we can do so by contradiction. Suppose a monochromatic edge \(e = (u', v')\) does exist. Without loss of generality, let \(u', v' \in L\), then both are even distances away from \(v\). If we connect the path from \(u'\) to \(v\), the path from \(v'\) to \(v\), and \(e\), we obtain an odd length cycle. However, this contradicts our original assumption and so we have shown that such a monochromatic edge could not exist.
