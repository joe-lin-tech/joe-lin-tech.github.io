I'm an undergraduate junior studying Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), with an intent to double major in Mathematics. I currently work in Professor Bolei Zhou's lab as an Undergraduate Researcher investigating pedestrian motion generation. My research interests are computer vision, generative AI, and reinforcement learning, especially within the context of autonomy in urban environments.

At UCLA, I serve as one of the Executive Directors of [exploretech.la](https://exploretech.la), an outreach and service organization, where I play a key role in running our annual technical workshops and 4-week program for 500+ local high school students. I'm also involved with the undergraduate student government, where I serve as one of the Chief of Staffs for the Office of the Internal Vice President.
